Refactoring

I made several changes to the original function to make it more readable:

    I split the function into three smaller functions, each with a single responsibility: getPartitionKey extracts the partition key from the event object, or creates one using the SHA3-512 algorithm if it's not provided; formatPartitionKey formats the partition key to be no longer than 256 characters and ensures it's always a string; deterministicPartitionKey orchestrates the entire process.
    I moved the constant values TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY and MAX_PARTITION_KEY_LENGTH inside the deterministicPartitionKey function because they are only used there.
    I added variable names that better describe the data being processed. For example, I renamed candidate to partitionKey, which is what the value represents.
    I removed unnecessary conditional statements by using a default value of TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY in the final return statement.
    I added comments to make the code easier to follow.
